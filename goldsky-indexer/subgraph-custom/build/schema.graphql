# ============================================================================
# EduVerse LMS Subgraph Schema v1.1.0 - PRODUCTION FIXED
# ============================================================================
# CRITICAL FIXES:
# 1. ✅ Added CourseSection entity (resolves Course Detail page blocker)
# 2. ✅ Added Certificate & CertificateCourse entities (efficient queries)
# 3. ✅ Optimized @derivedFrom relationships (The Graph best practice)
# 4. ✅ Added StudentCourseEnrollment for O(1) lookups
# 5. ✅ Maintained optimized entity structure for fast queries
